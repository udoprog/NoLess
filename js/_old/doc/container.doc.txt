Properties
	type = "Object_Container"
		- Type is used when the object is used with the toString() method.
	id = (First Constructor Argument)
	
	node = new Object()
	node.active = null
	node.post = new Array()
		- Node is used to keep track of which node is loaded into the container.
		! This is mostly for development purposes and it will hopefully one day be removed.
	
	object = null
		- 'object' defines which object the container actually contains.
	point = null
		- 'point' defines the object which the container is pointed at. This is where all content is appended.
	
	frame = false
	
	
	
	
	
	
	Manipulating Object of a Container
	implement( Element object );
		return-success: Container;
		return-failure: false;
		- Uses argument object to directly implement the container.
	
	implementText( String text );
		return-success: Container;
		return-failure: false;
		- Creates textnode and implements object on container.
	
	implementByTag( String tag );
		return-success: Container;
		return-failure: false;
		- Uses argument 'tag' that must be of object 'String' to create an element object to be implemented with the container.
	
	implementById( String id );
		return-success: Container;
		return-failure: false;
		- Uses argument 'id' to fetch the element that has the corresponding id to set an element object to be implemented with the container.
	
	Returning information from a Container.
	Object( void );
		return-success: Container object;
		return-failure: false;
		
	Point( void );
		return-success: Container;
		return-failure: false;
		
	Parent( void );
		return-success: Container;
		return-failure: false;
		
	Frame( void );
		return-success: Container;
		return-failure: false;
