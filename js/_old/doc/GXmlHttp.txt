	The original idea of this Object is the simplification of XmlHttp Requests integrated within Gnarf.
	It is also of importance that the object is self reliable and thereby have the ability to function
	standalone from the project.

	1.1 What is XmlHttpRequest?																				|
		XmlHttpRequests is a functionality within Javascript that allows the client to send http formatted
		data from a Browser Client to a server supporting recieving data trough either post or get methods.
		To be able to use this object you should have experience in working with Javascript in an
		Object-Oriented fashion and you should have knowledge in the basics of normal XmlHttpRequests.
	
	1.2 Examples.																							|

	var XHReq = new Grf_XmlHttp( [ID] ).setXHF( [XHF STRING] );
	XHReq.execute(
		[URL],
		[POST],
		[CALLBACK FUNCTION],
		[ALT XHF String]
	);
	
	[XHF STRING] is something used by GOperations module to determine which operations to be executed after
	recieving a request.
	It is important to note that these operations are defined afterwards and does not exist in the original
	distribution.
	[CALLBACK FUNCTION] can be compared to XmlHttpRequest.onReadyStateChange, it is called everytime
	Grf_XmlHttp	gets a response from the server.
