Log system is functional

	to be done before wednesday ( 2007-03-07 ):
		forum is going to be more stable with:
			- thread display ( displaying thread_name, creation date, posts, description )
			- entry display ( content , author , creation date )
			
	There is also some display work to be done, to make forum more easily navigatable and to make entries more sensible.
	
	TODO:
	
		XComDocument.php
			- rewrite module, atm lots of bad hacks, the system has been proven to work properly tho.
			plan:
				XComDocument->append - shall take several different arguments ( DOMElement , Array of DOMElement's , Assoc Array , String , etc... )
				XComDocument->readMsgHandler - shall be able to read a 'NMsgHandler' object to build outputs.
