	Try.each( function lambda [ , function lambda [ , ... ] ] );
	
	method tries each of the functions sent as argument and returns the first one that is sucessful
	
	ex.
		function clickNotify() {
			alert( "you clicked" );
		}
		
		var element = €$E ( "span" );
		
		// Add event and ignore failure due to browser support.
		Try.each(
			function() { return element.addEventListener( "click" , clickNotify , true ) },
			function() { return element.attachEvent( "onclick" , clickNotify ) }
		);
		
		insted of actually doing this, use the function €$addEvent
	
returns true if @lambda is 'valid'
returns false if @lambda is not 'valid'
