	$Css( string path , string id );
	@1( string path ):
		string: defines the path of where the css file resides
	@2( string id ):
		string: defines the id the css element is going to have
		
	This function is useful when you wan't to have several css files and have easy access to change between these.
	If the function stumbles over an existing id it will simply just change the href on it to correspond with the new css,
	effectively changing the path.
