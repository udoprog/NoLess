	Try.ifString( function instance );
	@1( function instance ):
		function: object to test if it is valid 'class'
	
	note! 'class' in javascript is practically synonym with 'function'. Just alittle different. I personally finds this annoying that's why ive been trying to write the 'Class' object bundle but it wasn't a great success, maybe in the future.
	
returns true if @instance is class
returns false if @instance is not class
